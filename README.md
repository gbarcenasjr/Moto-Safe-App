# Moto-Safe-App
First Personally Built App. The App will immediately tell the user the level safety a city currently is while displaying a report below on said city! The safety Label and each aspect of the ride (Weather, Temp., Wind) will be color coded from Green (Safe), Yellow (Uncomfortable), Orange (Risky) and Red (Very Risky).

# Notes:

As of now, there are a few bugs that needs to be fixed. For example, when entering a city's name, the user has to press the search button twice in order to update the UI.
Another is that the time displayed on the Riding Aspects is based on the device's time, not based on the city's actual time.

New updates will optimize the UI for readability across all supported iPhones and iPads.
